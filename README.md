## About

> It closely follows this [youtube tutorial by "LeMaster Tech"](https://youtu.be/qCA7FBwKOgI).

Don't expect much fun, the game is linear.
If an option gives 5 times more credits, it takes 5 times more time.
So, to sum up, it's not fun to play.

But, hey, one can still learn something from it?
